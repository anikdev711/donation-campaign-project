Question and Answer

Question: Add at least 3 Project features

Answer: The donation campaign project is completed using React JS, React Router, Hook, Tailwind CSS, and different component libraries. The attractive features of this website are described below.

* There is a fixed nav bar on this website. On the left side, there is a logo. On the right side, there are three menu items: Home, Donation, and Statistics. When a menu item is clicked, it redirects to the respective page, and the menu item is shown activated and underlined. If any pages are not found, then a 404-error page will be shown.
* The banner section has a background image, a title, and a functional search bar. When anyone searches in the search bar for the category name displayed on the home page, then specific searched categories are shown. For example, if anyone searches for “Health” as a category name (case-sensitive), then only “Health” category cards will be displayed.
* There are 12 cards on the home page. When a card is clicked on,  it will show the details of the card on the donation details page. On the donation details page, there will be a donate button, and the price will be mentioned. When the donate button is clicked, it will be added to local storage and displayed on the donation page.
* On the donation page, a maximum of 4 cards will be shown by default. If there were more than four cards of donations, then a button called “See All” appeared. When the button is clicked, it will show all donations. Another button called “Delete all donations” is clicked, and then all donations will be deleted from the local storage and donation page.
* On the statistics page, a pie chart of my donation and total donation in percentage value is displayed. Actually, these statistics show my donation compared to total donations. The result is shown in percentages.
